### Welcome to my Profile!

I am a security researcher at Sandia National Laboratories. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Central Florida, where my focus was in software security, especially as it relates to Internet of Things (IoT) devices and protocols, building automation systems (BAS), and cloud-based servers.
